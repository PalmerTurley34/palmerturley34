#### I'm a Backend and Machine Learning Engineer based in Washington, UT.

I started programming in 2020 to further my intersts in statistics and data analysis. I entered Bloom Tech Institute of Technology in January 2020, as a student in the data science program. I learned a lot about data anaylytics, machine learning, backend web development and more. In my career I've worked on many diverse projects such as creating and maintaining web APIs, creating batch processing servers, building gui/tui apps to aid in developer productivity, and training machine learning models vital to company succes.

Recently, my focus and interest has been in backend development, specifically using Go. I've built a few projects in Go to help me learn the language and sharpen my skills as a backend developer. You can see a few of them pinned on my profile.
